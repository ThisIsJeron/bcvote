				<h1>bctech.vote</h1>
				<p>To ensure a more well-represented democracy, we need as many citizens to vote. In the 2016 election, only 57.9% eligible voters voted. A whopping 92,671,979 US citizens that were eligible to vote did not vote. A huge problem for a lot of voters is that voting is very inaccessible, such as voting stations being too far away, or having to wait several hours just to vote, which many people do not have. An easy solution would be to vote by text message, however the obvious issue is that there seems to be a lot of ways for vote fraud to occur. Fortunately, this can be solved with using blockchain technology to verify votes.
